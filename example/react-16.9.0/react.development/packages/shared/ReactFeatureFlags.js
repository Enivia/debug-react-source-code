// Helps identify side effects in begin-phase lifecycle hooks and setState reducers:


// In some cases, StrictMode should also double-render lifecycles.
// This can be confusing for tests though,
// And it can be bad for performance in production.
// This feature flag can be used to control the behavior:


// To preserve the "Pause on caught exceptions" behavior of the debugger, we
// replay the begin phase of a failed component inside invokeGuardedCallback.


// Warn about deprecated, async-unsafe lifecycles; relates to RFC #6:


// Gather advanced timing metrics for Profiler subtrees.

// Disable javascript: URL strings in href for XSS protection.


// React Fire: prevent the value and checked attributes from syncing

// These APIs will no longer be "unstable" in the upcoming 16.7 release,
// Control this behavior with a flag to support 16.6 minor releases in the meanwhile.

// We will enforce mocking scheduler with scheduler/unstable_mock at some point. (v17?)
// Till then, we warn about the missing mock, but still fallback to a sync mode compatible version

// Temporary flag to revert the fix in #15650


// For tests, we flush suspense fallbacks in an act scope;
// *except* in some of our own tests, where we test incremental loading states.


// Changes priority of some events like mousemove to user-blocking priority,
// but without making them discrete. The flag exists in case it causes
// starvation problems.


// Add a callback property to suspense to notify which promises are currently
// in the update queue. This allows reporting and tracing of what is causing
// the user to see a loading state.


// Part of the simplification of React.createElement so we can eventually move
// from React.createElement to React.jsx
